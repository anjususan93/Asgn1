                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>I am a 1st year Graphic Design student at Humber College. I am in my 2nd semester of an Advanced Diploma Program. After studying the sciences for about 7 yrs I decided to make a career change to the arts. I have always enjoyed <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> working creatively. I have done art pieces with ink, coloured pencils and watercolours. I also tried print making in the past.
                        <br>
                    Untill recently, most of my artist abilities were restricted to my sketchbook, bullet journal and birthday cards for my family. Now as a Graphic Design student I am learning to use my creative skills to create proffesional pieces.</span></p>
